Medium was back in the day the best place to blog. I've never really blogged, just wrote a thing or two from time to time. So the cost of maintaining a full wordpress and paying $10/month didn't make any sense back then.

However, these last years there's been a renaissance of static site generators, partially thanks to the amazing [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). I've used gulp, grunt, rollup, webpack, etc. in the past quite extensively so I was very curious about static site generators.

The best thing in my opinion is that they are very unopinionated: HTML from handlebars or liquid, and inject the markdown content. Add some metadata as front-matter, and that's it. So on this side, I was very curious and wanted to throw together [the prototype Create-Static-Web](https://github.com/franciscop/create-static-web).

At the same time, I had grown unhappy with the way that Medium started to push users.
