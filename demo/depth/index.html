ABOUT THIS CODE

This code isn't pretty; it isn't supposed to be pretty at all! It is a fun
experiment where I typed away as fast as my fingers followed my brain. Sometimes
faster, so there will be plenty of bugs and edge cases.

In the future, I might decide to:
- Clean it up and set it as a library so that me and other people can use it.
- Repurpose the critical snippets into a large product (I am making a robot).
- Do nothing! It was fun, I finished it and now I'm focused on other things.

So far, if you want to reuse this code, please ask for permission. It is NOT MIT
as [most of my other repositories](https://github.com/franciscop/)
